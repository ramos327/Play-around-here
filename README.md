# Who is John Josselyn?

During the colonial period, English colonists were establishing new cities and making many discoveries. Naturally these discoveries and cities would attract more Englishmen to come and see if they can make discoveries of their own. In 1663 a man named John Josselyn came to New England for the second time in his life and stayed there for about 8 years. He would write a book called _New England Rarities_ that told about the flora and fauna that could be found in New England.[^1] The Flora that is mentioned is a very wide range of plants that have multiple uses for them. Some plants that were told by John were like Cornacae where the bark is used for both a tonic and as a toothbrush and Mayweed used to help with old sores. The book had a wide-range of how plants can be used to help with many illnesses and wounds that were valubale to everyone including the Spanish. Even though little is known about John, his book received recognition by historians and philosophers for his way of gathering information. For his plants section he heavily references “An Indian” when he talks about a concoction or how a plant can be used to help with a wound or sickness. The information he gathered on medicinal plants came from Native Indians instead of English physicians and made me wonder “Why did he seek medical advice from Native Americans?” Well Native Americans were actually very knowledgable when it came to herbal medicine. They knew about many plants and how they can cure many illnesses that would be helpful to the English, especially since they were still new to the land and they needed ways to fight new sicknesses and dieseases that they may not have encountered back in England.

# Spanish Physician
The most common thought for why the English did not take any medical knowledge from the Native Indians was because they did not have any medical system for finding these plants. Spanish physician Nicolás Monardes would be the first to explore what would be the United States and in his work _Joyfull Newes out of the newe foundd World_ was first translated to English in 1577 saying that the Indians gave the Spanish many valuable medicines that could cure many diseases including “the hoolie Woodde” a root that was used for both Europeans and Americans for many years to help cure syphilis and other diseases.[^2] Nicholas especially highly praised sassafrass, a plant that was used universally to cure many diseases. Finally, Nicolás goes as far to even say “sicke of any maner of evill which commeth unto them, sharpe, or large, hot, or colde, grievous or otherwise, they…have it for a universal remedy for all manner of deseases.”

# Rejecting Knowledge
The Native Indians were keeping information to themselves and not giving anything to Englishmen. A traveling clergyman named John Clayton had written about Indian physicians in Virgina. He gave praise to them saying that they could cure many illnesses and many colonists that have seeked these Indian physicians, have been cured of their illness, and have had better success than white physicians. Even though he came with great praise, he also came with irritation because he tried to find out more about Indian medicine, than what information the Indians were willing to give. This made Clayton frustrated and even pushed him to the conclusion that the indigenous people did not know or care for why their medicine was working.[^3]

# Conclusion      
Even though little is known about John Josselyn, his book showed a new form of gathering information that was necessary for both survival and advancement of English knowledge. This also showed how knowledgeable the Native Americans were in the medicinal field. Yet because of the reasons that I have said in this essay the English reject this knowledge because of false information spread due to frustration, Native Americans keeping to themselves, and because of political conflicts between the English and Native Indians. This essay also shows that Native Americans did have a medical system in order to know how these medicines worked. Native American medicinal knowledge was rejected by the English by looking at documents before the English colonists came to the U.S. to the early 18th century. This is what made John’s book unique because of the information it gathered.
