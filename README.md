# Who is John Josselyn?

During the colonial period, English colonists were establishing new cities and making many discoveries. Naturally these discoveries and cities would attract more Englishmen to come and see if they can make discoveries of their own. In 1663 a man named John Josselyn came to New England for the second time in his life and stayed there for about 8 years. He would write a book called _New England Rarities_ that told about the flora and fauna that could be found in New England. The Flora that is mentioned is a very wide range of plants that have multiple uses for them. Some plants that were told by John were like Cornacae where the bark is used for both a tonic and as a toothbrush and Mayweed used to help with old sores. The book had a wide-range of how plants can be used to help with many illnesses and wounds that were valubale to everyone including the Spanish. Even though little is known about John, his book received recognition by historians and philosophers for his way of gathering information.

# The Indian
For his plants section he heavily references “An Indian” when he talks about a concoction or how a plant can be used to help with a wound or sickness. The information he gathered on medicinal plants came from Native Indians instead of English physicians and made me wonder “Why did he seek medical advice from Native Americans?” Well Native Americans were actually very knowledgable when it came to herbal medicine. They knew about many plants and how they can cure many illnesses that would be helpful to the English, especially since they were still new to the land and they needed ways to fight new sicknesses and dieseases that they may not have encountered back in England.

20th century after the earring worn by the girl portrayed there.[^1]
